# CleanWrite

A Medium-like, WYSIWYG editor for writing that exports to an html file. Based on the amazing [Medium Editor](https://github.com/yabwe/medium-editor) JavaScript utility, which is also the core of [Peasy's](https://peasy.pushpullfork.com) writing/editing environment. To try CleanWrite, check it out at [http://pushpullfork.com/cleanwrite](http://pushpullfork.com/cleanwrite).

(I haven't given any thought to the name, so it will likely change. In any case, it's mainly for personal use anyway.)
