# Peasy Composer

A Medium-like, WYSIWYG editor for writing that exports to an html file or a GitHub-ready MarkDown file. Based on the amazing [Medium Editor](https://github.com/yabwe/medium-editor) and [Medium Editor Insert](http://linkesch.com/medium-editor-insert-plugin/) JavaScript utilities, and designed to pair well with the [Peasy](https://peasy.pushpullfork.com) CMS. To try Peasy Composer, check it out at [https://peasycomposer.pushpullfork.com/](https://peasycomposer.pushpullfork.com/). I highly recommend full-screen mode.

Image uploads work best in Firefox. All images are converted to base-64 and included directly in the HTML file.
